# Xception

In this activity, you will use the pretrained `Xception` CNN model to predict image labels.

## Instructions

* Use the starter notebook [Xception.ipynb](Unsolved/Xception.ipynb) for this activity.

* Visit the [Xception](https://keras.io/applications/#xception) documentation to determine the image size and any other parameters needed to load and use the model.

* Preprocess the test image by using the model's `preprocess_input` function.

* Use the trained model to predict the output label for the [puppy image](Images/pup.jpg).

### Bonus

* Refactor your code into a reusable function that accepts an input image and returns a preprocessed image.

* Test the code by preprocessing the image of a [kitten](Images/kitten.jpg) and printing the predicted labels.
